Build a full modern, responsive, smooth animated single-page website for a company called "LaconiX Corporation" (LX Corp). The website should have a vertical scroll-based layout with 3 distinct full-screen sections, navigable via a sticky top navbar.

ðŸ”¹ Sections:
1. Ecommerce (Digital Product Buy & Sell): Design a visually appealing ecommerce section with glowing digital product cards, add-to-cart buttons, and a clean layout. This section will be used as a landing page for social media ads as well.
2. Video Production: A section that includes a chatbot UI placeholder (for future OpenAI integration). The chatbot will help customers schedule video production orders. Include business highlights and service showcase here.
3. Development: Provide a clean UI for users to browse & select web templates and submit a form to order development. Display template thumbnails with selection buttons.

ðŸ”¹ Navbar:
- Sticky at the top
- Smooth scroll or motion blur zoom-in-out transition when clicking a tab (no full page reload)
- Tab Names: Ecommerce, Video Production, Development

ðŸ”¹ Animation & UI:
- Use modern JS animation libraries like GSAP or smooth CSS transitions
- On scroll: gravity-bounce like smooth flow
- On click: blurry-glow effects on buttons
- Page transitions: center-focused motion blur zoom
- All animations must be cleanly separated in reusable modules or components so I can easily edit or replace them later using Cursor AI

ðŸ”¹ Design Goals:
- Unique, creative, futuristic look
- Mobile & desktop responsive
- Animations must be GPU-optimized and performance-friendly
- Light/dark theme switcher (optional)
- All sections should feel like part of a seamless storytelling website

ðŸ”¹ Code Requirements:
- Use modular, well-commented code
- Separate sections/components in files or blocks
- Add placeholder content and dummy images for now
- Use plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks), or if required, use lightweight libraries (no React, Vue unless you absolutely must)
- Make it easy for me to later open in Cursor AI or Replit and edit animation settings, text, images, and button behaviors

Do not build backend or admin panel for now. Focus only on the front-facing user experience with high-end design and animations. I will customize and extend later.
